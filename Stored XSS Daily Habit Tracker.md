# Stored XSS Vulnerability in Daily Habit Tracker

### Title: Stored XSS Vulnerability in Daily Habit Tracker
### Affected Component: /endpoint/update-tracker.php
### CWE: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)

### Impact:
The web application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the project assignment functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "day" parameter,
which is used to assign project names. When unsuspecting users view the assigned project names, the injected script executes within their browsers, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking or data theft.

### Proof of Concept (POC):
To exploit the stored XSS vulnerability, attackers craft a payload containing malicious JavaScript code and inject it into the "day" parameter while assigning a project. For example, 
submitting the payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-By-Reynaldo')>` triggers an alert box when viewed. This demonstrates the successful execution of arbitrary scripts within the application.
