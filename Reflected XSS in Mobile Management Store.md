# Reflected XSS in Mobile Management Store

### Title: Reflected XSS in Mobile Management Store
### Affected Parameter: /?p=products&search=
### Affected Component: product.php
### CWE: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)

### Impact:
The web application is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the search functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the search function,
which is used to find certain products.

### Proof of Concept (POC):
To exploit the reflected XSS vulnerability, attackers craft a payload containing malicious JavaScript code and inject it into the search functionality. For example, 
submitting the payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert('xss-by-reynaldo')>` triggers an alert box when viewed. This demonstrates the successful execution of arbitrary scripts within the application.
