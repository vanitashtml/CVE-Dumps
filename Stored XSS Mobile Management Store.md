# Stored XSS Vulnerability in Mobile Management Store

### Title: Stored XSS Vulnerability in Mobile Management Store
### Affected Component: /endpoint/update-tracker.php
### CWE: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)

### Impact:
The web application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the update profile functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "firstname" parameter,
which is used to assign in updating profile details. When unsuspecting users view the first name of other customer, the injected script executes within their browsers, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking or data theft.

### Proof of Concept (POC):
To exploit the stored XSS vulnerability, attackers craft a payload containing malicious JavaScript code and inject it into the "day" parameter while assigning a project. For example, 
submitting the payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert('xss-by-reynaldo')>` triggers an alert box when viewed. This demonstrates the successful execution of arbitrary scripts within the application.
